too many people are not smiling :(, so I made a quick script to only let you use volume on your computer when smiling!

model used: https://github.com/Shohruh72/Emotion_onnx

(yes this is vibe coded)

## run on your own!
so you want to always also be smiling?? just run these commands!

first install the dependencies:
```
pip install -e .
```

then run the code!
```
python3 -m smile_volume
```

(fyi this works on macos only)
